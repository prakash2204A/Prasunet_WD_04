                <h3>MENTORING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</h3>
                <P>JAVA, Springboot,MySQL</P>
                <p>Mentoring aims to help mentees grow by teaching them how to manage change, bounce back from failure, and embrace 
                    new opportunities.
                     Implemented and designed data replication workflows to ensure databases synchronize accurately and punctually.
                     We utilized Java and Spring Boot for the development of the mentoring management system.</p>
                     <p>We aim to give paperless mentoring between mentee and mentor</p>

                <p>The Exam on Demand (EOD) payments system, utilizing cryptocurrency, endeavors to transform the examination payments process 
                    through the utilization of blockchain technology.
                    Engineered a groundbreaking cryptocurrency-based payment platform for the EOD system, leveraging blockchain to streamline 
                    payment processes, leading to a 60% increase in transaction security and a 30% decrease in payment disputes.

                <h3>E-COMMERCE WEBSITE</h3>
                <p>HTML,CSS,React.js,Javascript,MySQL</p>
                <p> E-commerce (electronic commerce) is the buying and selling of goods and services, or the transmitting of funds or data, over 
                    an electronic network, primarily the internet.
                    Enhanced the efficiency and responsiveness of website data management. This project not only honed my full-stack development skills but also provided me with a deep understanding of best practices in e-commerce web development.

                <h3>APP BASED ATTENDANCE SYSTEM</h3>
                <p>JAVA,Android Studio</p>
                <p>
                    For my college project, I developed an app-based attendance system designed to streamline the attendance tracking process for both students and faculty. Using technologies such as Java for Android development, Firebase for real-time database management, and a RESTful API for server-side operations, the app allows students to mark their attendance through their mobile devices. The system features user authentication, QR code scanning for secure check-ins, and a real-time dashboard for faculty to monitor attendance records. This project improved my skills in mobile app development, database integration, and user interface design, while addressing a practical need for efficient and accurate attendance management in an academic setting.</p>

                <h3>PHOTO GALLERY MANAGMENT SYSTEM</h3>
                <p>I developed a photo gallery management system aimed at organizing and managing digital images efficiently. Utilizing technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP for the web interface, and MySQL for database management, the system allows users to upload, categorize, and search for images easily. Key features include user authentication, image tagging, and dynamic photo galleries that can be filtered by tags or categories. This project enhanced my skills in web development, database integration, and user experience design, providing a robust solution for managing large collections of digital photos effectively.
